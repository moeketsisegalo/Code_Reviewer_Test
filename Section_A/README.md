Python Task: Option 1

Positive aspects of the submission:

Well done, on successfully solving the anagram grouping problem.
Your code correctly groups the anagrams together based on the given input.
The code uses a dictionary to store the anagrams, which is a suitable data structure for this task.
The variable names are descriptive and the indentation is consistent, following the recommended Python style guidelines.


Aspects of the submission that could be improved:

Efficiency (Line 5): The code can be optimized by using a character count-based approach to identify anagrams. This approach avoids the need for sorting each string and can have a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the average length of the strings.

Documentation: There are no comments provided in the code to explain its purpose, logic, or input/output. Adding appropriate comments or docstrings would improve the code's readability and make it easier for others (including yourself) to understand and maintain the code in the future.

Overall feedback:

Overall, the code is correct and efficient, but it can be improved by adding documentation. Well done on solving the anagram grouping problem! Keep up the good work! If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask.
