# Space Complexity Analysis Report

The space complexity of an algorithm determines how much memory it requires to run, relative to the size of the input. This report aims to analyze the worst-case space complexity of the provided solution for converting a number to its word representation.

## Memory Consumption

The solution utilizes several arrays to store word representations of units, teens, tens, and thousands. These arrays have fixed sizes and do not rely on the input size. Therefore, their space requirements are constant and do not contribute significantly to the space complexity.

The groups list stores the divided groups of three digits from the input number. In the worst case scenario, where the input number is very large, the number of groups will be proportional to the number of digits. However, since the maximum number of digits in a long integer is fixed at 19, the space required by the groups list is considered constant.

The result string is used to store the word representation of the number. The length of this string is proportional to the number of words in the representation. In the worst case, when every digit in the input number is non-zero and each group has a non-zero value, the number of words can be estimated as logarithmic to the input number. Thus, the space required by the result string can be considered logarithmic to the input size.

## Recursive Function Calls

The SayNumber method makes recursive calls to the SayGroup method for each group of three digits in the input number. In the worst case scenario, where the input number has the maximum number of groups (6 groups for a 19-digit number), the recursive depth will be 6. Since the recursive calls do not accumulate memory with each call, the space required for the recursive calls is considered constant.

## Worst-Case Space Complexity

Based on the analysis above, the worst-case space complexity of the provided solution can be summarized as follows:

Constant space complexity for the fixed-size arrays and the groups list.
Logarithmic space complexity for the result string.
Constant space complexity for the recursive function calls.
Therefore, the overall worst-case space complexity of the solution is O(log N), where N represents the input number.

In simpler terms, the solution manages memory usage efficiently by minimizing excessive memory consumption. It limits the space requirements to a logarithmic scale relative to the input size. This ensures that the space used by the solution increases at a slower rate as the input number grows, resulting in an optimized use of memory resources.

This concludes the Space Complexity Analysis Report. The provided solution demonstrates efficient space usage by employing techniques that keep the space complexity relatively low.
