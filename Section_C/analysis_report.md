Space Complexity Analysis Report


The space complexity of the provided solution, which converts a number to its word representation, can be summarized as follows:

* The solution uses fixed-size arrays to store word representations, which have a constant space impact.
* The groups list, used to store divided groups of three digits, also has a constant space requirement.
* The result string, storing the word representation, grows logarithmically with the input number.
* Recursive function calls have a constant space impact.

Overall, the worst-case space complexity of the solution is O(log N), where N represents the input number.
This means that as the input number grows, the space required by the solution increases at a slower rate.
